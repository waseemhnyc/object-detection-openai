# [WIP] Object Detection using OpenAI GPT4-Vision

OpenAI recently introduced GPT-4 with Vision, enhancing their API with multimodal capabilities.

This lets developers create applications where users can ask questions about images.

I was wondering, could we use this model for object detection?

    "Where is the dog in the picture. Return with coordinates."

How does a LLM compare to a specialized object detection algorithm?
